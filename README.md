# Introduction

This is the code repository for *Meteor* (the WP3 Inventory), which will contain an interlinked knowledge graph of news sources, media organizations, and data archives in Europe (for details see the [OPTED main page](https://opted.eu/)). Currently, this is a prototype / work in progress.

*Meteor* is a web based application that allows users to

- browse & query the *Meteor* database
- Add new entries to the database
- edit and update existing entries

## Technical Details

- developed in the Python framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) (version 2.0.x)
- uses [DGraph](https://dgraph.io/) as backend / data storage

# Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements via pip (`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Install DGraph on your local machine (see [official documentation](https://dgraph.io/downloads/))
4. Launch your local DGraph instances (alpha and zero)
5. Launch the inventory via `python3 run.py` 
      - alternatively you can specify a configuration via `python3 run.py --config config.json`
6. Set the data schema to your DGraph instance via `python3 tools/setschema.py`
7. Add sample data to your DGraph instance using `python3 tools/sample_data.py`
8. Open your browser at your localhost with port 5000 (http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Backups

Currently backups are uploaded to ucloud (for data safety and convenience). If the amount of database dumps gets too large, a different solution would be preferred.

Backups are run by a user with root privileges, because database dumps are created by the `dgraph` user and thus, cannot be manipulated directly by other users. Of course it would be possible to run some `chown` magic though.

Make sure that the `requests` module is installed for the root user.

### Create Backup Settings

create a settings file (`backup.json`) inside the tools folder:

```json
{
    "ucloud_url": "https://ucloud.univie.ac.at/public.php/webdav/",
    "ucloud_token": "secret",
    "backup_path": "/mnt/public/backup/"
}
```

Make sure the directory `backup_path` exists and that the `dgraph` user has rights to write to it.

### Run backup

Simply execute the script `tools/backup.py`.

Add it as cronjob with `crontab -e`

```
0 1 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/user/wp3inventory/tools/backup.py
```

### Restore Backup

- Get backup files and run the following command: `dgraph live --files g01.rdf.gz --schema g01.schema --zero localhost:5080`
